  description <<-DESCRIPTION
    First of all, rm -rf is not safe to run.  If clit accidentally removes
    important directories, I don't want to be held responsible.

    It is fine to leave old folders there.  For example, a tag folder with no
    more stories.  This will tell the team, hey we used to tag stuff with this.

    Make sure the file is a symlink before removing it.  This is another safety
    measure.
